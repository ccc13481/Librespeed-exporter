# Speedtest Exporter

Simple **Librespeed exporter** for **Prometheus** written in **Python** using the
official CLI from **Librespeed**

Based on the work of MiguelNdeCarvalho, this is a rewrite of the python script to call and export statistics based on librespeed. The first version is only for test against the librespeed servers on NAL-Medienet, Korup AntenneLaug and AarslevNet.
